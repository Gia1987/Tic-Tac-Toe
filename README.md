# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
This program is going to reproduce the game Tic-Tac-Toe in JavaScript language.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
